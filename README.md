# SQA_INTERNSHIP_WEEK-5🔐 Week 5 – Security Testing & Vulnerability Analysis

This project focuses on identifying and analyzing common web application security vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10 framework.

The objective was to understand how QA engineers perform basic security testing and document vulnerabilities using industry-standard tools and reporting practices.

This project was completed as part of structured training under DevelopersHub Corporation.
